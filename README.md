## Data Cleaning

The data is cleaned by scaling. Scaling adjusts the values so that they are more similar in scale. This allows for a 
better comparison that does not give more weight to certain columns. 

## Clustering

Then we determine the best number of clusters by finding the best value for k by using the elbow method. For this
data, 4 was the best. Then the clusters are applied and a visual is created for analysis.

## PCA

Then the data is analyzed after applying PCA. This allows for most of the data to be analyzed. It drops some data 
in order to analyze more efficiently. It does this while still maintaining accuracy. 

## Clustering PCA Data

The PCA data is now clustered the same as the original data. It looks for the best number of clusters and applies the
clusters. They both find4 as the ideal number of clusters. 

## Determining Weights

Finally the code looks at what had positive influnce on each component.

 ## Citations
 
 All code was based on examples from class.
